But whether this will actually occur, is currently extremely questionable, because presently, in a totalitarian manner, everything is directed towards interests which are economic, military, political and cultural – as well as towards that which is strict fundamentalist religious-sectarian – and based on enormous lies and devious, misanthropic, criminal and felonious machinations in every imaginable regard. This also means that the population of the USA is spied upon by the secret services and even severely within the neighbourhoods, and so forth, and, in every possible manner being restricted in its freedom, and this is in addition to the violence, as it emerges in some form or other, both openly and covertly.﻿\n",

The shooting in Utah unwarranted because he ran, don't know why he ran but if you lunged at the police with the fake sword you should have taken that opportunity for immediate action right then. He ran and was shot 6 times in the back. We know a large group of cops are corrupt and these murderers are nothing new. Though I have ran from the police many times when I was in my teens, cops just pursue and find him hiding some where. Not just put 6 bullets in the back ending a life.

The day it happened, the officer said that it was because Mike Brown was walking in the street. Then a few days later, it was because he had robbed a convenience store. Despite the fact that owner himself says that his store was never robbed. The officer was apparently in fear for his life. The PD claims he was \"seriously injured\" in the altercation with Mike Brown. Even though there is a video showing the officer, perfectly fine, standing by Mike's body an hour after the shooting. Also, Mike's body was 35 feet away from where the officer was when Mike apparently \"charged\" at him. Man, the police are full of shit.
